# Sales-Dashboard-Using-Power-BI

Hello Everyone,

I am excited to share with you the Sales Dashboard crafted in Power BI, utilizing the Sample Sales Excel Workbook. 

## Objective:

The aim with this Power BI Dashboard Project is to delve deep into the Sales Report.

## Purpose:

I aspire to build a visually captivating dashboard that not only provides an overview of the sales metrics but also empowers stakeholders to make well-informed business decisions.

## Sections in the Report:

The report is thoughtfully segmented to facilitate efficient data management:

- Data Slicing: Users have the flexibility to dissect the data by Year, enabling focused analysis.
  
- Key Metrics Cards: I have integrated cards displaying essential metrics such as Total Sales, Quantity, Average Devlivery date and Number of Return orders, offering a quick snapshot of the sales data.

- Stacked Column Chart: This visually intuitive chart plots Profit against the Customer names, allowing for easy identification of the purchase made by top 10 customers.

I am excited about the potential of this dashboard to enhance the Sales analysis and decision-making processes. Your feedback and suggestions are greatly valued as I continue to refine and optimize this tool.

Regards,

Abinaya
